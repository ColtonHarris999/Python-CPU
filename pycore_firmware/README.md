# pycore_firmware

Pure-Python software that ships in the pycore boot image (ROM).

At tape-out, this tree is compiled to bytecode and placed at fixed memory
locations so the core can initialize itself (booter / BIOS) and resolve
LEGB **B**uildin calls by jumping the PC into precompiled ROM — or, for
tiny helpers, by inlining their bytecode.

## Builtin model

Hot builtins are seeded in the boot-record **builtins dict** as
`OBK_BUILTIN` handles (`BI_LEN`, `BI_RANGE`, …). `LOAD_GLOBAL` /
`LOAD_NAME` resolve globals then that dict; `CALL` runs hardware fast
paths for known tags (e.g. `len(list)` reads the list header).

Pure-Python modules under `builtins/` implement **miss / protocol**
paths (e.g. `len(obj)` → `obj.__len__()`), not slower rewrites of the
fast paths. Bytecode and CALL work needed to finish this split is in
`planning/builtins_bytecode_support_plan.md`.

## Layout

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `builtins/` | Pure-Python miss-path / ROM builtins + `builtins.md` inventory |

Testing today uses hex images for specific memory locations (same flow as
other pycore precompiled fixtures).
